# delivibes-app
This is a mobile application built with React Native that allows users to order dishes from different restaurants, add items to a basket, and search for restaurants. The app uses Expo CLI for development, Redux for state management, Sanity.io for data management, Tailwind for styling, and React-Native Maps for restaurant location and directions.

The app is currently deployed on [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/@syntheticquimera/delivibes-app?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go)
